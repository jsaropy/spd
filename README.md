# Systematic Program Design - edX Coursework

My solutions and problem sets for the **How to Code: Systematic Program Design** series on edX by the University of British Columbia (UBCx).

> Note: These courses are now archived on edX, but all materials are still accessible for self-study.

Each folder contains `.rkt` files with my implementations following the systematic design recipes taught in the course (data definitions, templates, tests, etc.).
