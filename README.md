# Systematic Program Design - edX Coursework

My solutions and problem sets for the **How to Code: Systematic Program Design** series on edX by the University of British Columbia (UBCx).

This series teaches a systematic approach to program design using design recipes (HtDF, HtDD, HtDW, etc.), focusing on clear, testable, and maintainable code rather than a specific language. The courses use **DrRacket** with **Beginning Student Language (BSL)**, a teaching subset of Racket.

### Courses Covered
- [How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-systematic-program-design-part-ubcx-spd1x) (Core method, simple data, interactive programs)
- Part 2 (Compound data, lists, trees, helpers) *(in progress / completed)*
- Part 3 (Advanced topics, larger programs) *(in progress / completed)*

> Note: These courses are now archived on edX, but all materials are still accessible for self-study.

### Repository Structure

├── week1/              # Example: Problem sets from Week 1
├── week2/
├── ...
├── projects/           # Larger projects (e.g., interactive games)
├── quizzes/            # Design quizzes and solutions
├── notes/              # Optional: Personal notes or summaries
└── README.md

Each folder contains `.rkt` files with my implementations following the systematic design recipes taught in the course (data definitions, templates, tests, etc.).

### Language & Environment
- **Language**: Beginning Student Language (BSL) in Racket
- **IDE**: DrRacket (recommended for step-by-step execution and built-in checker)

To run the code:
1. Install [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/)
2. Choose "Beginning Student" as the language level
3. Open and run the `.rkt` files

### Notes
- These are my personal solutions for learning purposes.
- I followed the design recipes strictly to practice the methodology.
- Spoiler warning: If you're taking the course, try solving problems yourself first!
